From 1822, it was subdivided into ten dÃ©cimos. The sol was also issued during this period and was equal to the real, while the peso was worth eight reales and the escudo was worth sixteen reales. This 1836 eight-escudo gold coin was issued by the Argentine Confederation, a predecessor state of modern Argentina, featuring a portrait of the Argentine politician and general Juan Manuel de Rosas on the obverse, and a depiction of a mountain with crossed flags and cannons on the reverse. Only six of these coins are known to exist; this one forms part of the National Numismatic Collection at the Smithsonian Institution. ";
